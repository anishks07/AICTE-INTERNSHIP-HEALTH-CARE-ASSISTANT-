# 🏥 AI-Powered Healthcare Assistant Chatbot

This project is a simple, interactive AI healthcare assistant built using **Streamlit** and **HuggingFace Transformers (GPT-2)**. It serves as a demo chatbot that responds to general healthcare-related queries while maintaining caution on sensitive topics.

> 🔬 Built as part of the **AICTE Internship Project** under the domain of Artificial Intelligence and NLP.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **GPT-2 Based Text Generation**: Uses HuggingFace’s GPT-2 model to generate human-like responses for open-ended queries.
- 🩺 **Rule-Based Safeguarding**: For sensitive healthcare topics (e.g., symptoms, medication, appointments), the bot gives safe, predefined replies.
- ⚡ **Fast and Lightweight**: Runs locally using Streamlit with minimal resource usage.
- 💬 **Interactive UI**: A clean and simple UI built with Streamlit for real-time chatting.

📋 How it Works
The chatbot works based on simple conditional logic and GPT-2 generation:

If the user mentions "symptom", "appointment", or "medication", a pre-defined caution message is returned.

For any other input, GPT-2 generates a natural language response using HuggingFace’s pipeline.

💡 Sample Interactions
User Input	Bot Response
"I have symptoms of fever and cough"	"Please consult a doctor for accurate advice."
"Can I book an appointment?"	"Would you like to schedule an appointment with your doctor?"
"Tell me about diabetes"	[Generated by GPT-2]

🧠 Future Improvements
Add Named Entity Recognition (NER) for smarter intent classification.

Integrate with real appointment systems or telemedicine APIs.

Add voice-based input/output using tools like SpeechRecognition and gTTS.
